    "# Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them \n",
    "    - This is image classification, typically performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs; see Chapter 14 ). \n",
    "- Detecting tumors in brain scans \n",
    "    - This is semantic segmentation, where each pixel in the image is classified (as we want to determine the exact location and shape of tumors), typically using CNNs as well. \n",
    "- Automatically classifying news articles \n",
    "    - This is natural language processing (NLP), and more specifically text classification, which can be tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), CNNs, or Transformers (see Chapter 16 ). \n",
    "- Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums \n",
    "    - This is also text classification, using the same NLP tools. \n",
    "- Summarizing long documents automatically \n",
    "    - This is a branch of NLP called text summarization, again using the same tools. \n",
    "- Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant \n",
    "    - This involves many NLP components, including natural language understanding (NLU) and question-answering modules. \n",
    "- Forecasting your company’s revenue next year, based on many performance metrics \n",
    "    - This is a regression task (i.e., predicting values) that may be tackled using any regression model, such as a Linear Regression or Polynomial Regression model (see Chapter 4 ), a regression SVM (see Chapter 5 ), a regression Random Forest (see Chapter 7 ), or an artificial neural network (see Chapter 10 ). If you want to take into account sequences of past performance metrics, you may want to use RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers (see Chapters 15 and 16 ). \n",
    "- Making your app react to voice commands \n",
    "    - This is speech recognition, which requires processing audio samples: since they are long and complex sequences, they are typically processed using RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers (see Chapters 15 and 16 ). \n",
    "- Detecting credit card fraud \n",
    "    - This is anomaly detection (see Chapter 9 ). \n",
    "- Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a different marketing strategy for each segment \n",
    "    - This is clustering (see Chapter 9 ). \n",
    "- Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful diagram \n",
    "    - This is data visualization, often involving dimensionality reduction techniques (see Chapter 8 ). \n",
    "- Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past purchases \n",
    "    - This is a recommender system. One approach is to feed past purchases (and other information about the client) to an artificial neural network (see Chapter 10 ), and get it to output the most likely next purchase. This neural net would typically be trained on past sequences of purchases across all clients. \n",
    "- Building an intelligent bot for a game \n",
    "    - This is often tackled using Reinforcement Learning (RL; see Chapter 18 ), which is a branch of Machine Learning that trains agents (such as bots) to pick the actions that will maximize their rewards over time (e.g., a bot may get a reward every time the player loses some life points), within a given environment (such as the game). The famous AlphaGo program that beat the world champion at the game of Go was built using RL. \n",

    "- Supervised Learning - training data is labeled \n",
    "    - Ex. A labeled training set for spam classification\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning - training is unlabeled\n",
    "    - Clustering\n",
    "        - K-Means\n",
    "        - DBSCAN\n",
    "        - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n",
    "    - Anomaly detection and novelty detection\n",
    "        - One-class SVM\n",
    "        - Isolation Forest\n",
    "    - Visualization (clustering groups of data) and dimensionality reduction\n",
    "        - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "        - Kernel PCA\n",
    "        - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)\n",
    "        - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "        - Tasks:\n",
    "            - Feature Extraction: merging correlated variables into one, such as car milage and age can be combined to create wear and tear\n",
    "            - Anomaly Detection: \n",
    "                - detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud\n",
    "                - catching manufacturing defects \n",
    "                - automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm.\n",
    "            - Association Rule Learning\n",
    "                - dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes. \n",
    "    - Association rule learning\n",
    "        - Apriori\n",
    "        - Eclat\n",
    "- Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "    - Ex. Google Photos \n",
    "        - Once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just add one label per person 4 and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos. \n",
    "    - Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and supervised algorithms. \n",
    "        - For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsupervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques. \n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "    - The learning system: called an agent in this context, \n",
    "        - can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards, as shown in Figure 1-12 ). \n",
    "        - It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy , to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation. \n"

    "- Model-based learning\n",

    "    - Solutions:\n",
    "        - Simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters (e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data, or by constraining the model.\n",

    "        - Reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors and remove outliers).\n",
